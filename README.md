# PRODIGY_ML_01
Implemented a Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

Description:

Added Dataset Loading:

Loaded the house price dataset from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing:

Extracted relevant features ('area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms') and the target variable ('price').
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Linear Regression Model:

Created a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Trained the model on the training set.
Evaluation:

Made predictions on the test set.
Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.
Visualization:

Plotted a scatter plot to visualize actual prices vs. predicted prices.
